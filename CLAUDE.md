This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is a static HTML website featuring Pokémon characters. The project consists of a single HTML file (`pokemon-welcome.html`) with embedded CSS and JavaScript - no build process or external dependencies required.

## Development
To view the website, simply open `pokemon-welcome.html` in any web browser. No build commands, package installation, or server setup needed.

## Architecture
The entire application is contained in `pokemon-welcome.html`:
- **Structure**: HTML5 markup with Japanese content
- **Styling**: Embedded CSS using modern features (Grid, Flexbox, gradients, animations)
- **Interactivity**: Vanilla JavaScript for button click handlers and alerts
- **Design**: Responsive grid layout with hover effects on Pokémon cards
